# Application of Virtual 3D Model Augmented Reality Technology

This project combines three-dimensional modeling and programming knowledge to enable VR, AR and related technologies. Its purpose is to combine the modeled 3D model with the OpenSpace3D editor to obtain the final result, which allows the user to perform corresponding operations on the model based on VR technology.
